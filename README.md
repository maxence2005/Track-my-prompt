The Track My Prompts application allows the use of an image recognition AI model. It can detect everyday objects and interpret prompts for more targeted searches.

## Features

- Object detection in images and videos
- Live detection through the webcam
- Prompt interpretation for more targeted detection

## Installation

To ensure Track My Prompts works correctly, you need a Python virtual environment of version 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12. Once the environment is created, install the dependencies listed in the 'requirements.txt' file.

### GPU Acceleration

If your computer has an Nvidia RTX graphics card, you can install 'torch 2.3.x' and 'torchvision 0.18.x'. This will speed up the processing of images and videos.
